# CS506_final_project

## Project Description
Studying the relationship between video game data and sales is of significant importance. Firstly, this research can help developers and publishers better understand player behavior and preferences, allowing them to optimize video game design and marketing strategies. Additionally, such research can provide valuable market insights for investors, helping them assess the potential success and risks associated with a video game. Finally, understanding the relationship between video game data and sales contributes to the healthy development of the entire industry, guiding future innovations. Therefore, a deep analysis of this data is crucial not only for the success of individual video games but also for the evolution and growth of the entire gaming ecosystem.

## Goal
The goal of this project is to predict sales of video games in different regions based on their genre, platform, publisher, and release year.

## Data Collection
We will need a dataset that collects video games with their genre, platform, publisher, release year, and sales in different regions. The dataset will be obtained from Kaggle: EDA - VIDEO GAME SALES (https://www.kaggle.com/code/upadorprofzs/eda-video-game-sales#EDA---VIDEO-GAME-SALES-%F0%9F%8E%AE). This dataset was generated by scraping vgchartz.com.

## Modeling Plan
We plan to use clustering, decision trees, regression, and time series analysis to model the dataset.

## Visualize Plan
We plan to use scatter plots, decision tree visualizations, regression scatter plots, and time series plots to visualize our data.

## Test Plan
We plan to use 80% of the data for training and 20% of the data for testing.
