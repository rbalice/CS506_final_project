Project Description
Studying the relationship between video game data and sales is of significant importance. Firstly, this research can help developers and publishers better understand player behavior and preferences, allowing them to optimize video game design and marketing strategies. Additionally, such research can provide valuable market insights for investors, helping them assess the potential success and risks associated with a video game. Finally, understanding the relationship between video game data and sales contributes to the healthy development of the entire industry, guiding future innovations. Therefore, a deep analysis of this data is crucial not only for the success of individual video games but also for the evolution and growth of the entire gaming ecosystem.

Goal
The goal of this project is to predict sales of video game in different region based on their genre, platform, publisher, and release year. 

Data Collection
We will need a data set that collect video games with their genre, platform, publisher, release year, and sales in different region. The data set will be get from Kaggle website: EDA - VIDEO GAME SALES. (https://www.kaggle.com/code/upadorprofzs/eda-video-game-sales#EDA---VIDEO-GAME-SALES-%F0%9F%8E%AE). This data set was generated by a scrape of vgchartz.com.

Modeling Plan
We plan to try on using clustering, decision trees, regression, time series analysis to model the data set.

Visualize Plan
We plan to use scatter plot, decision tree visualization, regression scatter plot, and time series plot to visualize our data. 

Test Plan
We plan to use 80% of data for training, 20% of data for testing.
